# Introduction

mntr makes it possible to specify the contents of the /etc/fstab file using
multiple fragments stored in /etc/mntr.d directory.  The main purpose of this
tool is to facilitate automatic management of NFS mounts on multiple Linux
machines. However, it can also be used to manage local disk mounts on a single
machine.  If your Linux distribution does not provide /etc/fstab.d, mntr will
be a good replacement.

# How does it work ? 

mntr reads fstab snippets from /etc/mntr.d directory.
Snippets contain lines defining filesystem mounts, the same as found in
/etc/fstab. Comments can be used to specify additional mntr options. 
All snippets are concatenated and merged into /etc/fstab. Markers separate
mntr generated content from original fstab.

** Additional features include: **

* an option which tells mntr to unmount a NFS filesystem if the server is unreachable. 
mntr is careful not to suspend on I/O wait.
* an option to specify an alternative mount line: if the primary NFS server is not
reachable, mntr will remount the filesystem using another server.

** Upcoming features: **

* --force-unmount option which will attempt to terminate processes using a filesystem
before unmounting it.

* specify pre_ and post_ (u)mount commands. The commands can be used to stop
certain services before unmounting the filesystem, and start them after
mounting. (Example: stop apache, unmount /var/www, mount /var/www from another
server, start apache)

# Configuration management software (Puppet, Chef, ...)

You may use a configuration management software to distribute mntr snippets.

## Puppet 

You can manage /etc/fstab with Puppet and mntr at the same time. Puppet
<pre>mount</pre> resource works 'per line' and mntr keeps track of it's own
lines separated by markers. Of course, things will go wrong if you try to
manage the same filesystem with both mntr and Puppet.
